# Simple-Grade-Checker
This simple C program reads a student's marks as input and outputs the corresponding grade based on standard grading criteria. It uses conditional statements (if-else) to categorize marks into grades from A to E and indicates failure for marks below 50. The program also handles invalid inputs gracefully.
